# Example project (in progress)

The application is intended to present an example MVVM architecture of an Android application.
The application has been divided into modules
- data - modules for handling data from the server
- feature - modules containing the UI layer
- core - modules used as extensions or libraries for other modules

The application uses Jetpack Compose entirely, along with navigation adapted to this library
